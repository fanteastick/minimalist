I've been writing down my dreams for almost all of quarantine - for about a week I entertained the idea of writing a substack newsletter for it! This was what some dreams look like when I'm fresh awake and half-coherent.

<!--more-->

### Preface
Writing down my dreams has been a pretty fun experience. I really enjoy telling them to my friends while we play video games :) I usually have 2 dreams a day, but occasionally forget them. I'm usually influenced by stuff I see a lot in my life, like Webtoons that I read or video games that I play. I'm not affiliated with any of these companies. 

### Onwards with some actual dreams

#### Dream 1: battling mud things
Fighting these big sludge idk but they weren’t a gross mud ifyou know what I mean
Had swords that equipped kinda and I think `friend's name` was the shopkeeper

*Notes:* 
- The swords were probably B.F. Swords like in League
- The sludge probably looked like Ditto from Pokemon

#### Dream 2: returning to China
Had a dream I was going to China because lack of internship and I had to explain the situation to a family friend
Then I got ticket receipt but honestly could not find when my flight was even though everything should’ve been printed - I searched really hard but the only lead on a piece of paper was weirdly blurred out so I kept planning to call mom
Then I went shopping at Ranch 99 with grandma to get food/snacks but also I remembered in the dream that usually you can’t bring produce on a plane soooo idk I rly wanted snacks and Pocky tho 
Then I was debating which shoes to bring (decided on blue for walking and slides for hot days) but also it started pouring and we had a window on the upper right corner of the entrance that we don’t actually have, can’t close it bc too high and water started gushing in. Had to mop it all out and also mop out the flooded front yard which looked completely different than usual (circular XD what kind of house is this) and then I thought about strategies to get paid for photography

*Notes:* 
- I'm not particularly good at photography so I'm unsure why I was thinking of getting paid for it...
- I'm usually pretty careful with things like flight confirmations and ticket receipts
- I can't remember if I had to explain to the family friend in Mandarin or in English

#### Dream 3: neeko is best decision
Dream as Neeko
Was in a big fighting ring and multiple contestants whoever killed me as Neeko would be given a rly big reward
Multiple rounds timed
Had to use many tricks but also neeko’s kit is not that complicated so one girl after fooled by the clone once was like “I know what’s going on now” 

*Notes:*
- Neeko is my favorite champion in League of Legends! She's a cool chameleon character that can transform into other characters' appearances and send out clones
- The big fighting ring was pretty similar to the one in early God of High School fighting rings

#### Dream 4: clash tickets, please
Dream played clash after my nap but insanely tired so I kept napping and then I had to get dishes done but also joined the wrong discord when I got back `friend's name` was like ??? So r we playing anything but the call was full of strangers and I rejoined the right one in the right discord
Then we played clash but I was still tired so I took a nap in the middle
Then I woke up in real life and thought I missed clash

*Notes:*
- Clash is the tournament for league of legends players that happens on various weekends throughout the year. It's a pretty fun experience with friends! I'm in tier IV though haha...
