Welcome to my blog; this is the very first blog post that I'm making for my personal blog! I have chosen the theme Minimalist from Marc Weitz. More info inside the post.

<!--more-->

This is the link to more information about the theme I've chosen: [Minimalist][minimalist-origin]

This is my base site: [Eilleen's Homepage][eilleeenz]

### How I set up the site:

1. Choose theme (linked above)
2. Made subdomain (CNAME record pointing to my `user.github.io` and named `min`)
3. A mess of various tutorials: [Jekyll quickstarts][jekyll-docs]
4. Insert frustration, taking healthy breaks, fiddling with multiple different settings
5. Fix the css stylesheet linking by reading through [this gitlab thread][gitlab-thread]
6. Done!

### Planned additions/changes to the blog:
- [x] change overall styling to match my main website
- [x] more intuitive & easy-to-see tagging system
- [x] updating the subdomain name
- [x] writing the 'About' page
- [ ] set up Travis CI (currently keeps breaking, unsure why)
- [x] link to blog from main site
- [ ] twitter feed box somewhere; maybe like a "socials" page? Because I post frequently on twitter
- [x] switch to https
- [ ] a distinct blogging/writing style :)

Thanks for reading!
