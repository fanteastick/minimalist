This past weekend I participated in [MLH's][mlh-homepage] last virtual event for the summer, [Sun's Out Hack's Out][soho-homepage]. Read this post to learn more about what my team and I made.

Teammates: myself, Ellie, Eugene, Clair

### Project Information:
- Title: Feel-ter Photobooth
- [Project devpost page][soho-devpost]

- Description: 
    - A fun photobooth that can remind you of happy summer times - This photobooth uses face recognition to read your emotions and adds cool filters to your face.
- TLDR of the devpost: 
    - Learned many Python things: PyQt5, OpenCV, Azure Facial recognition API

### Some thoughts on the virtual hackathon: 
I've been attending hackathons since sophomore year of high school but this was my first time participating in a <mark>virtual hackathon</mark>. I've always seen them posted online but they seemed more like <span class = "wavy_underline">"coding competitions"</span> rather than the hackathon experience that I've come to love. 

In hindsight, I definitely prefer the in-person hackathon experience. Debugging with my teammates was harder because we couldn't see what was happening on each others' screens very easily, and some of my teammates didn't use git bash so they didn't have the project locally on their computer at all. I didn't go to any workshops this time around (which is usually a part of hackathons that I really enjoy) since this event was based around the EDT time zone ~~so i wasn't awake during the workshops haha~~. 

I really admire how the MLH team still put in a lot of effort for virtual hangouts, like times to chat around a topic, or play [Spaceteam][spaceteam]. Despite that, I miss walking around the hackathon venue and casually striking up conversation with other hackers hanging out, or asking them about their project-in-progress. 

On the other hand, there were definitely many benefits to hacking at home. For one, my house isn't filled with the sound of tens/hundreds of people talking simultaneously. I get to code on my monitor setup and I have all the space I need. I also get to eat all the snacks I have at home :)

Some technologies that were really helpful during this virtual hackathon were:
- <mark>Discord</mark>: <span class="wavy_underline">screensharing</span> was helpful for showing the current project and pair programming. Also we had <span class="wavy_underline">various channels</span> like `#code-snippets` where we could send links to things we were referring to, like documentation. For <span class="wavy_underline">actual coding</span>, we all sat together in a voice call and unmuted when we needed to talk.
- <mark>Github</mark>: not much to explain here :)
- <mark>Codeshare</mark>: used it for about ten seconds but still was helpful for those ten seconds. [link][codeshareio]
