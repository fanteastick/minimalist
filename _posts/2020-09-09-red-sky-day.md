Today the air quality in the Bay Area was pretty bad due to the fires across California. I snuck out of the house with my DSLR camera to get some photos. 

<!--more-->

This morning I woke up and everything was dark but also slightly orange, so I was immediately really scared because I thought things in my area were burning down. (Turns out they are, but not in the *immediate* area). The smoke was above the marine layer (?) so we weren't breathing it but the sun was blocked. It kind of felt like nighttime all day, which really threw me off. 

## Info about my camera:
- <span class = "wavy_underline">Canon 5D Mark IV</span> (from a great person on Ebay thank you)
- Lens: [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM][lens] (also bought on Ebay thank you)
- Photos edited with: [Adobe Lightroom][lightroom]
