I participate in the [100 Days of Code][100doc] challenge! Visit the link to learn more. Essentially, what I do is: 
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

Check out my [Twitter][twitter] for daily updates on the challenge!
